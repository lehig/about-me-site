I’ve been programming since I was 14 years old, and 
ever since then, I haven’t stopped learning and creating.
 What started as a curiosity for how code works has grown 
 into a lifelong passion for building systems that are 
 efficient, secure, and meaningful.

I’m currently pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science with 
an emphasis in Algorithms and Machine Learning at Brigham 
Young University–Idaho, where I’ve gained a deep 
understanding of how math, logic, and good software design 
come together to solve real-world problems.

Recently, I interned as a Software Engineer at BoomID, 
where I developed cloud-based systems using Go and AWS to 
analyze photo metadata for biometric authentication and 
designed a secure “lock box” for encrypted file sharing. 
Through that experience, I discovered how much I enjoy 
bridging front-end, back-end, and cloud architecture to 
deliver full solutions.

Beyond the technical side, I’ve also worked in customer-
facing roles where I learned the importance of empathy, 
clear communication, and teamwork—skills that now 
influence how I approach both people and code.

I’m passionate about writing clean, maintainable code, 
continuously improving my craft, and collaborating on 
projects that make a difference. I’m currently working 
on several personal projects involving Go, React, and 
AWS, with the goal of refining my skills in full-stack 
and cloud-native development.
