## Food Truck Locator

[This](https://github.com/lehig/food-truck-locator) is a project I am 
working that incorporates front-end, back-end, and APIs, all using AWS 
products to accomplish it. It will be a platform for small businesses such 
as food trucks will be easily found by local consumers. It will be a 
place where local consumers can subscribe to notificaitons from the food 
trucks. 

## Duneology

[Project link](https://lehig.github.io/wdd130/duneology/index.html)

This website is a simple one that uses HTML and CSS to showcase the vast 
worldbuilding that happened for Dune to come about. This website has a couple 
of pages that show different styles and techniques that I learned along the way.
