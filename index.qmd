Hello and welcome to my portfolio showcasing the different 
projects that I've worked on, the accomplishments I've 
achieved, and the journey I've gone through as a Software 
Developer. I build thoughtful, end-to-end software that 
bridges elegant front-end experiences with powerful, 
cloud-native back-ends.

As a full-stack developer specializing in Go, React, 
and AWS, I’m passionate about creating reliable systems 
that solve real problems — from secure data pipelines to 
seamless user interfaces. I approach each project with 
curiosity, precision, and a drive to learn, aiming to 
craft software that’s as scalable as it is meaningful.

This site showcases my ongoing projects, technical 
explorations, and the creative process behind my work 
as a developer.
