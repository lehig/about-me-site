## Construction Date

[Project link](https://turbo-adventure-73gl5qg.pages.github.io/250_Projects/project4.html)

Using a decision tree machine learning algorithm, I developed a model to 
determine whether a house was built before or after 1980, based on several 
data points. The report indicates that the number of stories a house has, the 
type of garage, and the living area significantly contribute to the algorithm’s 
ability to determine the construction date.
