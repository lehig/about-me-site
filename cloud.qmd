## Food Truck Locator

[Project link](https://github.com/lehig/food-truck-locator)

This is currently a project I am actively working on. It uses AWS products like S3, 
DynamoDB, Amplify, Lambda, and others to create a website from back to front. It 
will be a platform for small businesses such as food trucks will be easily found 
by local consumers. It will be a place where local consumers can subscribe to 
notificaitons from the food trucks.
