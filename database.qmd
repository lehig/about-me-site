## Star Wars Database Design

[Star Wars Database](https://turbo-adventure-73gl5qg.pages.github.io/250_Projects/project5.html)

From a database of survey responses from people who like Star Wars, I created 
new dataframes that would help answer some questions about the data. These new 
datatframes also helped me make a machine learning algorithm that predicted a person's 
income based on the info gathered in the surveys.
