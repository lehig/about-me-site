    "text": "Hello and welcome to my portfolio showcasing the different projects that I’ve worked on, the accomplishments I’ve achieved, and the journey I’ve gone through as a Software Developer. I build thoughtful, end-to-end software that bridges elegant front-end experiences with powerful, cloud-native back-ends.\nAs a full-stack developer specializing in Go, React, and AWS, I’m passionate about creating reliable systems that solve real problems — from secure data pipelines to seamless user interfaces. I approach each project with curiosity, precision, and a drive to learn, aiming to craft software that’s as scalable as it is meaningful.\nThis site showcases my ongoing projects, technical explorations, and the creative process behind my work as a developer.",

    "text": "Lehi Gracia\n\nFeel free to send me an email\nLet’s connect on LinkedIn\n\nI’ve been programming since I was 14 years old, and ever since then, I haven’t stopped learning and creating. What started as a curiosity for how code works has grown into a lifelong passion for building systems that are efficient, secure, and meaningful.\nI’m currently pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science with an emphasis in Algorithms and Machine Learning at Brigham Young University–Idaho, where I’ve gained a deep understanding of how math, logic, and good software design come together to solve real-world problems.\nRecently, I interned as a Software Engineer at BoomID, where I developed cloud-based systems using Go and AWS to analyze photo metadata for biometric authentication and designed a secure “lock box” for encrypted file sharing. Through that experience, I discovered how much I enjoy bridging front-end, back-end, and cloud architecture to deliver full solutions.\nBeyond the technical side, I’ve also worked in customer- facing roles where I learned the importance of empathy, clear communication, and teamwork—skills that now influence how I approach both people and code.\nI’m passionate about writing clean, maintainable code, continuously improving my craft, and collaborating on projects that make a difference. I’m currently working on several personal projects involving Go, React, and AWS, with the goal of refining my skills in full-stack and cloud-native development.",
