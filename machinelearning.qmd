FyodorAI was a project we made as a team, where I was team lead, to put in practice the skills we were 
learning in class. This model uses Keras and TensorFlow libraries to build the model.
The model is then trained on Crime and Punishment, Brothers of Karamazov, The Idiot, 
and The Possessed, which are all found in the gutenberg online library. After this 
training, the model then recieves a prompt and from the prompt it creates a story. 

## ShakespeareAI

ShakespeareAI was a similar project that I spearheaded alone. In the same way, it 
trains a couple books of the Shakespeare plays and then with a prompt it can generate
up to 100 words. This uses the same libraries and technologies as the previous ones.
