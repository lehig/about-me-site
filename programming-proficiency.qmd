## C-Sharp

[This](https://github.com/lehig/cse210-projects/tree/main/prove/Develop04) 
is a meditation app that uses polymorphism to accomplish putting the user
in a meditative state. 

## Go

[This](https://github.com/lehig/WebCrawly) is a web crawler I made using 
Go and parallelism to scrape through the designated website.

## Python

[This](https://github.com/lehig/CSE251/blob/master/week03/assignment/assignment.py) 
is a program that removes greenscreen from a video and replaces it with 
the desired image. This uses parallism and concurrency to remove the green 
pixels from each image.
