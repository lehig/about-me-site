I am currently studying Computer Science with an emphasis in algorithms 
and machine learning. During my studies I have learned and applied 
different skillsets such as algorithmic thinking, web development, 
programming in different languages, and encryption. I have mastered the
basics of computer programming by understanding class structures, data 
structures, and object-oriented programming. 

Below are pages that will have links to different pojects I've worked on. 
If you have any questions about any of them, feel free to shoot me an email.
