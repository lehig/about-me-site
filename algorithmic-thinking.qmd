## Tic Tac Toe AI

[Project link](https://github.com/lehig/tic-tac-toe-AI) 

This is a project that encapsulates a simple algorithm in always winning tic tac toe. 
Originally designed to be played by two people, this program makes it possible to play 
tic tac toe with just yourself. The program uses Go as the only language.
